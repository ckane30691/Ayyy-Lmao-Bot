# Ayyy-Lmao-Bot

This is a simple Reddit bot written in Python.

Assuming you have Python already installed along with the praw library, simply open the file in your text editor, change the user agent to your reddit username, and change the subreddit to the subreddit of your choice.

You can run the file by double clicking on it or running it from the command line.  It'll ask you for your login information.  Once you're logged in the bot will scan the subreddit of your choice and make replies where appropriate.
